            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Third year computer science student at The University of Colorado Boulder, 
                driven by a love for data and a fascination with the math behind it. 
                I am especially interested in the intersect between data and linear algebra and its applications to modern technology such as AI. 
                Apart from that, I am also heavily interested in problem solving with algorithms and logic, as well as philosophy. 
                Outside of university, I am an avid coffee enjoyer, rock climber, and cyclist!</p>
