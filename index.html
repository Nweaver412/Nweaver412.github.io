          <p></p>
          <p>
            I am an undergrad student at The University of Colorado Boulder in the 
            <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/" target="_blank">College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, 
            studying Computer Science. In my time at University I was a software developer at 
            <a href="https://www.ingmarmed.com/" target="_blank">Ingmar Medical</a>,
            and am recently a software engineer at
            <a href="https://www.keboola.com/" target="_blank">Keboola</a>, working on the application of AI to existing workflows.
          </p>
          <p> 
            I am driven by a love for data and a fascination with the math behind it. 
            I am especially interested in the intersect between data and the usefulness of linear algebra. 
            Apart from that, I am also heavily interested in problem solving with algorithms, logic, topics in group theory, and philosophy. 
            Outside of university, I am an avid coffee enjoyer, rock climber, and cyclist!

            <p>
              Zoup is a python library inspired by the language <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage's</a> group capabilities, utilizing groups as a main data type.
              This is still a work in progress, but down the line I would like to add a lot more capabilities so that it is comparable with
              Sage, and hopefully eventually get to graphic generation, similar to <a href="https://juliapoo.github.io/mathematics/2023/07/15/plotting-cayley-graphs.html">JuliaPoo's Cayley Graphs and pretty things</a>.
              I would also like to start getting it running like a full-scale operation with more utilization of github actions, version tracking and 
              eventually pip installable.
              Group Theory is still a new topic for me and I am loving learning as I go!

            <p>
              This project was recently started with my friend <a href="https://github.com/sath4713">Sam</a> and is a work in progress.
              The main goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the process of data collection, cleaning, and analysis, as well 
              as the adaptation of Neural Networks to real world and more complex applications.
              I think timeline as of right now is to get the data collection and cleaning done, and then start to work on the model having 
              it prepared for next season, using next season as validation, and then betting the season after if we are satisfied with the results.
              I do think that as we go we will learn to, and want to automate the features including data collection and training, turning the project
              into a full scale CI/CD pipeline. It would be cool to have this as a widget or something, where it can optimize bets at the click of a 
              button lol.

            <p>
              Since learning about Linear Algebra, I've been fascinated by embeddings and dimension reduction as a means to understand the data we are handling.
              <a href="https://github.com/jordanrburger">Jordan</a> sent me the <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow Word Embedding</a> a while back and it has been such a source for inspiration.
              As I get more interested in data science, I think understanding what PCA and t-SNE are beyond just what they mean is a huge breakthrough for me!
              Overall this is jus a fun little notebook I was playing around in, and learned a lot with. Stoked to have done it and learned from it!
