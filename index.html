            I am an undergrad student at The University of Colorado Boulder in the 
            <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/" target="_blank">College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, 
            studying Computer Science. In my time at University I was a software developer at 
            <a href="https://www.ingmarmed.com/" target="_blank">Ingmar Medical</a>,
            and am recently a software engineer at
            <a href="https://www.keboola.com/" target="_blank">Keboola</a>, working on the application of AI to existing workflows.

            I am driven by a love for data and a fascination with the math behind it. 
            I am especially interested in the intersect between data and the usefulness of linear algebra. 
            Apart from that, I am also heavily interested in problem solving with algorithms, logic, topics in group theory, and philosophy. 
            Outside of university, I am an avid coffee enjoyer, rock climber, and cyclist!

            <p>
              Zoup is a python library inspired by the language <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage's</a> group capabilities, utilizing groups as a main data type.
              This is still a work in progress, but down the line I would like to add a lot more capabilities so that it is comparable with
              Sage, and hopefully eventually get to graphic generation, similar to <a href="https://juliapoo.github.io/mathematics/2023/07/15/plotting-cayley-graphs.html">JulesPoo's Cayley Graphs and pretty things</a>.
              I would also like to start getting it running like a full-scale opertaion with more utilization of github actions, version tracking and 
              eventually pip installable.
              Group Theory is still a new topic for me and I am loving learning as I go!

            <a href="https://github.com/Nweaver412/Streamlit-OpenCV"><h3>Streamlit OpenCV</h3></a>
            <p>
              The idea bahind this project was originally to make a streamlit application connected to the spotify web api,
              putting a user's friend's information in a 3d-interactive plane to see how music tastes group and vary, using some dimension reduction algorithms.
              I was able to figure out how to get through the OAuth, as I realized you cannot access friends taste from a user's login.
              Thus, we move on! Newest idea is to make an openCV streamlit app, where you can input an image of a sodoku board and have a returned board.
              I think the first goal is jpeg upload or something, and then moving to real time camera input. 
              This project is very much in the works, so be patient!

            <a href="https://github.com/Nweaver412/Mushroom-PCA-t-SNE"><h3>Mushroom Experiment Notebook</h3></a>
            <p>
              Since learning about Linear Algebra, I've been fascinated by embeddings and dimension reduction as a means to understand the data we are handling.
              <a href="https://github.com/jordanrburger">Jordan</a> sent me the <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow Word Embedding</a> a while back and it has been such a source for inspiration.
              As I get more interested in data science, I think understanding what PCA and t-SNE are beyond just what they mean is a huge breakthrough for me!
              Overall this is jus a fun little notebook I was playing around in, and learned a lot with. Stoked to have done it and learned from it!
